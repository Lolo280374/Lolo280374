<h6>MY USERNAME IS NOT LOGDOTZIP!!!</h6>

## who am i
### hi, i won't do a huge biography because honestly i'm failing grammar class on my own, but i love coding, making stuff, watching anime, and idk learning stuff on my own (i hate being taught by a teacher i just prefer watching youtube courses and doing the stuff on my own)
### so far i'm not doing anything crazy i don't work for nasa i just do shit projects to spend time and to try learning a couple languages that could be valuable in the near future or something, and to participate in cool events from hackclub, like siege!! (i really need that framework. please olive. give me framework 13. i need itttttttt)

---

## projects?
### i do some projects that are absolutely out of wack and make no sense, but some i actually enjoyed making, like clickSiege - google sheets is not a good db!! and openYourRadio, because seeing it actually work is so fun! coding is so fun when stuff actually works. genius right?
### maybe more projects coming soon, check repos i guess.?
### and some projects are just dead abandonned like the crunchyroll-webOS thing, that TV is just way too slow to handle shit i give up dude
